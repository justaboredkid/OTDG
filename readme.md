# Open Tactile Data Glove

In NO way this is PRODUCTION READY.


**O**pen **T**actile **D**ata **G**love, or **OTDG** for short, is a glove that senses tactile feedback. 

O is for **O**pen, which means that the glove is OPEN SOURCED. It is under the SolderPad hardware license v2.0 (Which is a warp around of the Apache 2.0 License), and it allows a “*perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license under the Rights to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, make, adapt, repair, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form and do anything in relation to the Work as if the Rights did not exist.*”

T is for **T**actile, where it describes the main purpose of the glove: to interpret tactile data. Even though the project was created for my science project (ASL interpretation), its use is far beyond just that. It can provide basic hand input for VR/AR purposes, robotic control, and it can also, if you write the software for it, emulate a mouse or something. It’s up to anyone. The foundations are here.

D is for **D**ata, describing that the glove is not a computation device on its own. It is only peripheral device. The current version of OTDG connects directly to a Raspberry Pi Zero. If you bought the wireless version of the RPi Zero (The RPi Zero W), it can expand the functionality of the glove by connecting to a phone and providing inertial sensor data. Future expansions might integrate the sensors inside the glove itself, but it does no processing on its own.

G is for **G**love. IT IS A GLOVE, what did you expect?
